Simulating Live Coding for Teaching and Technical Talks

This repository accompanies the [DSLC.io Project Club](https://dslc.io/) talk introducing the [{typeR}](https://fgazzelloni.github.io/typeR/) package.

The session presents the motivation, design, and implementation of `{typeR}`, an R package that simulates realistic live coding in the R console.


## 🎯 Talk Context

> *"Live coding is powerful — but risky"*

In teaching and technical presentations, we face a recurring trade-off:

- Static code is safe but removes cognitive flow
- Live coding is engaging but prone to errors

This talk explores how `typeR` addresses that dilemma.



## 📽 Presentation Slides

The full slide deck from the **Project Club session** is available here:

The slides cover:

- The live coding dilemma
- Design philosophy
- Core functionality (`typeR()` and `typeRun()`)
- Quarto integration
- Teaching and presentation use cases
- Design principles and future direction



## 🧠 What is `typeR`?

`typeR` is an R package that:

- Simulates character-by-character typing
- Optionally executes code while typing
- Works with .R, .Rmd, and .qmd files
- Integrates directly with the R console and RStudio

> *"The goal is not animation - the goal is controlled realism for technical communication"*


## 🔎 Minimal Example

```r
library(typeR)

typeR("script.R", delay = 0.05)

# Typing and execution:

typeRun("script.R", delay = 0.05)
```



## 📦 Installation

From CRAN:
```r
install.packages("typeR")
```

From GitHub:
```r
devtools::install_github("Fgazzelloni/typeR")
```



## 💬 Discussion Points from the Talk

During the **Project Club session**, we discuss:

- When live coding fails
- The psychology of teaching code
- Why process matters more than static output
- Design decisions behind minimal abstraction
- Trade-offs in simulation vs real-time execution
